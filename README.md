# Vishnu's Portfolio

Hey. I'm Vishnu
As you can see above I love basketball, science, and business. I am currently a student attemding Kitchener Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School and I am in the ninth grade. I have always been interested in sciences and space, as a child my dream was to be an astronaut in space and it still is. This has led me to pave my own path into advacing my learning outside of school for the great sciences.

In my free time I love to play basketball (huge warriors fan) and work out, I love sports in general but mostly basketball and boxing, I also love to spend time with family and friends and long drives. Hopfully that helped you learn a bit more about me
